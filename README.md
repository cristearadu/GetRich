# GetRich

This is an app for a course from university.
The idea is to donate money so you do not feel poor and see the list of users poorer than you.

The server and database is hosted by Firbase.

Login & SignUp with firebase.
You can edit your profile, donate money(not real money, just a bunch of strings variables), and see the users poorer than you. 
I used recycleView,RecyclerView.Adapter to iterate through all my users.
