# GetRich

This is an app project for university. 
The idea is to donate money so you do not feel poor and see the list of users poorer than you.
It was a fun application to work at and the feedback received from my teacher and colleagues was positive.

The server and database is hosted by Firbase.

Login & SignUp with firebase.
You can edit your profile, donate money(not real money, just a bunch of strings variables), and see the users that are poorer than you.
